## HTML Structure

The project uses semantic HTML tags to structure the content effectively:

- `<header>`: Contains the program title and navigation menu using `<nav>` and `<ul>`.
- `<section>`: Used for structuring content in different sections (about, missions, team, contact).
- `<article>`: Within the missions section, used to describe individual missions.
- `<figure>`: Used to associate images with captions for team members.
- `<address>`: Used within the contact section for contact information.
- `<iframe>`: Embeds a YouTube video.
- `<form>`: Contains the registration form elements.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Download the HTML files.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the SpaceX Exploration Program homepage.
3. Click on the navigation links to scroll between sections.
4. Users can fill out the registration form to express their interest in the program.

Please note that this is a basic example, and in practice, you would typically use a backend language like PHP or JavaScript to handle form submissions and further functionality.

Feel free to customize the content, styling, and functionality to meet your specific requirements.
